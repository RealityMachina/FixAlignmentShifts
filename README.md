# FixAlignmentShifts
Because taking a (Good) option shouldn't make you fail being a Paladin

Specifically, whenever you take a purely Good dialogue option:

If you are Chaotic or Lawful Good, the alignment shift change will be altered to either Chaotic Good or Lawful Good so you don't come at risk of shifting to Neutral Good.

Whenever you take a purely Evil dialogue option:
If you are Chaotic or Lawful Evil,  the alignment shift change will be altered to either Chaotic Evil or Lawful Evil so you don't come at risk of shifting to Neutral Evil.

Options that are specifically Neutral or Lawful or Chaotic will not be affected.
